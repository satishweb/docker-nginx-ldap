About
=====

The nginx-ldap Docker image provides a container, that contains a [nginx server](http://nginx.org/) with LDAP support.

This [nginx-auth-ldap](https://github.com/kvspb/nginx-auth-ldap) module is used for LDAP support.


Usage
=====

The docker image can be used like the [official nginx docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/nginx/).
But you have to overwrite the configuration file like to configure the LDAP authentication.

```
$ docker run --name nginx-server -v /path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro -d nginx
```

LDAP configuration
------------------

The documentation for the LDAP authentication and an example is [here](https://github.com/kvspb/nginx-auth-ldap/blob/master/README.md#example-configuration) available.
